You can use the 'ant jar' command to create a jar for this subproject.

Use the 'ant -f build-junit.xml junit' command to run all the Junit tests associated with the core jcyclone code. 
Note: one of the junit tests can take about 6-8 minutes to run, since it is setup to simulate a randomized set of threaded events.
